Function 1 is a random DNA sequence generator. It takes an input size for the DNA sequence length, then makes a vector of the given length with any combination of "A", "T", "G", and "C" with replacement. Then it concatenates the vector to a string with no spaces between the letters and returns the concatenated string.
